# Tim's uMotif Backend Challenge Solution

I've included a 'solution.md' in each directory detailing my answers and/or some of the decisions I've made and why.

I've also included my git repo in the root directory so you can see the changes I made.

If you have any questions about any of the code here feel free to send me an email any time at tr.white@outlook.com. Any feedback you can provide would also be great; I'm always looking for ways to improve.
